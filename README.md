## Local development

This project uses Docker to create a consistent environment for local development.

On macOS and Windows, Docker requires [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to be installed. Linux
users should install the Docker engine using their distribution's package
manager or [download a `.deb` or
`.rpm`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Once installed, we need to build our containers. We use
[`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to orchestrate the
building of the project's containers, one for each each service:

### `django`

Our custom container responsible for running the application. Built from the
official [python 3.9](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) base image

### `postgres`

The database service built from the official [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) image

### `marklogic`

A database server built from the official [marklogic](https://hub.docker.com/_/marklogic) image.


## Getting started

**NOTE**: For any of the following commands to work, you must first [install Fabric](https://www.fabfile.org/installing.html). Once installed, you can type `fab -l` to see a list of available commands.

### 1. Gain access to the Marklogic image

Access to the Marklogic Docker image is restricted to those who have 'purchased' it on Docker Hub. It's actually FREE to
purchase, but you need to fill out [a short form](https://hub.docker.com/_/marklogic/purchase).

### 2. Create `.env`

```console
$ cp .env.example .env
```

If you wish to use Marklogic in dev, set `MARKLOGIC_MOCK_REQUESTS` to False. See [Using Marklogic](#using-marklogic)
for instructions on how to populate your Marklogic database with data.

### 3. Compile frontend assets

With the dependencies installed as described in [Front end development](#front-end-development)

```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Build Docker containers

```console
$ fab build
```

### 5. Start Docker containers

```console
$ fab start
```

### 6. Start a shell session with the 'django' container

```console
$ fab sh
```

### 7. Apply database migrations

```console
$ python manage.py migrate
```

### 8. Run a 'development' web server

```console
$ python manage.py runserver_plus 0.0.0.0:3000
```

### 9. Access the site

<http://127.0.0.1:3000>

**NOTE**: Compiled CSS is not included and therefore needs to be built initially, and after each git pull.

## Additional development tips

### Quick start with `fab run`

While it's handy to be able to access the django container via a shell and interact with it directly, sometimes all you
want is to view the site in a web browser. In these cases, you can use:

```console
$ fab run
```

This command takes care of the following:

1. Starting all of the necessary Docker containers
2. Installing any new python dependencies
3. Applying any new database migrations
4. Starting the Django development server

You can then access the site in your browser as usual:

<http://127.0.0.1:3000>

### Available Judgments

- <http://127.0.0.1:3000/ewca/civ/2004/632>
- <http://127.0.0.1:3000/ewca/civ/2004/811>
- <http://127.0.0.1:3000/ewca/civ/2006/392>
- <http://127.0.0.1:3000/ewca/civ/2007/214>

### Running tests

```console
$ fab test
```

## Using Marklogic

If you wish to use Marklogic in development, you will need to run it in a Docker container of its own and populate
it with data.

### Bootstrap

Run `script/bootstrap-marklogic` to create local storage directories and the REST Application server in Marklogic.
You should only need to do this once.

### Importing Judgments data

Create a database in Marklogic and restore the data from an S3 bucket containing test Judgments data. Note that this
bucket is currently only available to dxw developers.

1. First, navigate to http://localhost:8001/, which will ask for basic auth. Username and password are both `admin`.
2. Then add AWS credentials to MarkLogic (under Security > Credentials), so it can pull the backup from a shared S3 bucket.
   The credentials (AWS access ID & secret key) should be for your `dxwbilling` account. You will need to create them in AWS
   if you haven't already.
3. Then create a database named `Judgments`in the Marklogic interface.
4. After creating the database, attach a `Forest` named `Judgments1`. The interface should tell you that the database
   does not have any Forests attached. To create this Forest click on the link provided within the interface, or click in
   the Forest folder and follow the instructions.
5. In the Backup/Restore tab in Marklogic for your new Judgments database, initiate a restore, using the following as the
   `"directory": s3://tna-judgments-marklogic-backup/`

Assuming you have entered the S3 credentials correctly, this will kick off a restore from s3. Once you have the data locally,
you can then back it up locally using the path `/var/opt/backup` in the management console. It will be backed up to your local
machine in `docker/db/backup`

Once Marklogic is set up, change `MARKLOGIC_MOCK_REQUESTS` to False and the application will read data from Marklogic
instead of the file system.

### Adding indexes

In theory the restore from backup should create indexes in the database. If it does not, you will need to create them
manually.

In the Marklogic admin interface, first create a namespace for the index. Go to `Databases -> Judgments -> Path namespaces`
and create a new namespace with the prefix `akn` and url `http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/ns/akn/3.0`

Then, go to `Databases -> Judgments -> Path Range indexes` and create a new index with the scalar type of `date` and
the path expression of `akn:FRBRWork/akn:FRBRdate/@date`. You can leave the other options as the defaults.

### Adding the XSLT transformation template

The XSLT which transforms the LegalDocML documents into HTML needs to be stored on Marklogic itself. To do this:

1. Open the Marklogic Query console at http://localhost:8000/
2. Copy the text in `judgments/boostrap/set_up_xslts.xqy` and paste it into the XQuery console
3. Run it against the database `Modules` using the `XQuery` query type (see the dropdown options in the UI to configure
   these)
4. Once the script has run, click `Explore` to ensure the XSLT is in place, it should be called
   `/judgments/xslts/judgment2.xsl`

### Marklogic URL Guide

- http://localhost:8000/ this is the query interface where you can browse documents in the `Judgments` database.
- http://localhost:8001/ this is the management console where you can administer your database.
- http://localhost:8002/ this is the monitoring dashboard.
- http://localhost:8011/ this is the application server for the Marklogic REST interface
All four URLs use basic auth, username and passward are both `admin`.

## Using the pre-push hook (optional)

Copy `pre-push.sample` to `.git/hooks/pre-push` to set up the pre-push hook. This will run Python linting and style checks when you push to the repo and alert you to any linting issues that will cause CI to fail.

## Front end development

Included in this repository is:

* Webpack and Babel for transpiling JavaScript
* Sass for compiling CSS

### Working with SASS/CSS

* Ensure you have NodeJS & NPM installed.
* Install SASS globally by running `npm install -g sass`.
* To watch and build the site SASS, run `npm run start-sass`
* To modify styles, navigate to the `sass` folder in your editor.

### Working with JavaScript

* In a new terminal session run `npm run start-scripts` to kick off a Webpack watch task

### Internationalisation

We're using [the built-in django translation module](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/translation) to handle our translations.

#### Adding translations

1) Ensure that the `i18n` module is loaded at the top of the file:

```django
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% load i18n %}
...
```

2) Add the translation string to the page:
```
<h1>{% translate "namespace.mytranslation" %}</h1>
```

3) Update the locale file by running the following command:
```
django-admin makemessages -l {langage_code}
```

where `language_code` is the ISO 3166-1 country code (e.g. en_GB)

4) In the generated `.po` file, find the generated msgid string and add the translation below it

```
msgid "naamespace.mytranslation"
msgstr "This is my translation"
```

5) Compile the translations to a binary file:
```
django-admin compilemessages
```
