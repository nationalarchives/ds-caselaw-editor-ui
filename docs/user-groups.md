There are a number of differences in the UI depending on the user's groups:

### Only superusers and editors can:

- Delete documents
- See the enrich and reparse buttons
- See the delete button if the judgment is not a failure (normal users can if it’s a failure)

### Developers can, on the identifiers page

- See “human readable” and “score” columns
- See schema namespaces, uuids and MarkLogic URI

### Developers can, on the history page

- See event number, Submission sequence number and Marklogic version
- See the calling agent
